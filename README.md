# RoboMuse-4.0

## ROS Package for IIT Delhi's Indigenous Mobile Manipulator - RoboMuse 4.0

RoboMuse is a mobile robot platform. Its development started in 2009 and was initiated by Prof. SK Saha. It started as a line following robot, and over the years, it has had many iterations, with each iteration adding something unique to the robot. The main aim of RoboMuse was to be able to function without any human interaction. This was achieved on RoboMuse 4.0, using the Robot Operating System (ROS). RoboMuse 4.0 was later converted into a mobile manipulator by mounting a 5-DOF manipulator and was used to perform a pick-and-place task using various computer vision techniques. This repository contains the ROS package files for RoboMuse 4.0
